## Overview
We will: explain how DA benefited accounting (1), its life cycle, types of DA and benefits

**Importance:** plays significant role in business operations and decision-making (multiple approaches, techniques and dimensions). *Remember:* data is
unpredictable but we can identify **trends, patterns, information**, so we can **increase profit, get better resource utilization and improve managerial operations**

(1) Excel sheets (manage *cash flow*), if we can't track we can't control. Small business lack of data or resources. Process Improvement and Risk Management.
Three impacts : **auditors** monitor, analyze, verify data for recommendations **tax accountant** use DS to analyze taxations, faster investment decisions, higher profit

Process Flow: Define goals, identify metrics, list/collect/extract data, explore /analyze data, interpret/visualize data, infere for decision-making

**Life Cycle**: Discovery (business domain and resources), Data Preparation (ETL: extract, load and transform), Model Planning (identify techniques and data to
understand variable relationships), Model building (testing, training and production), Communicate Results (Identify key findings, develop narrative for
stakeholder), Operationalize (final reports, briefs, codes and technical documents)

## Types of Data Analytics
- Descriptive Analytics (what happened?): get more information about past (*summary of facts*): **Data aggregation** (data gather and summarize: MS Excel, MATLAB
  SPSS, STATA) and **Data Mining**
- Diagnostic Analytics (why did this happened): Deeper look at data to see root causes: **Drill-down**, **Data mining**, **Data discovery** and **Correlation**. Why
  sells have decreased of why does someone sell less than expected
- Predictive Analytics (What will happen): future outcomes in terms of probability to events occur (e.g. sentiment analysis, recommenders)
- Prescriptive Analytics (how we can we make it happen): solution for what has been predicted

### Example: Amazon
- Diagnostic Analytics: revenue increased in West Coast in previous year -> increased spending in sales training
- Historical purchases: price, time, weather -> revenue is expected to grow x%
- Descriptive Analytics: Amazon has spent 20M in sales training in previous year
- Prescriptive Analytics: Identify sales training that fetch good ROI and implement optimization plan (which drop which continue)

## Benefits
- Decision-making: faster and better (digital marketing strategy), customer satisfaction and revenue, define customer target, preferences,
  location, popular brand, forecast demand, identify seasons, sentiment, optimum prices
- Cost reduction : (every click is monitoring) and we can see browser interest (wider demands), reduce fail campaign. Shopping patterns, demographic and time
  of purchase, weather data. Plan campaign: use predictive analysis. Example: 642B are returned because consumer miss info during purchase
  (footwear, clothing).If know which info, then can control the return rate.
- Identify potential problems, operations that yield bet results, error-prone areas
### Amazon example
They know what are you going to buy because predictive analysis and anticipate shipping (*increase sales, inventory and reduce supply chain cost*). For example,
choose warehouse near to customer (shipping cost like when some habitant buy something during a season). **Discount:** manage discount and prices (based on 
**website activity, competitor pricing, product availability, item preferences, order history, expected profit**). We cn use Power BI, Tableau and Logic
