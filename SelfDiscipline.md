#  Self-Discipline: Build Habits & Develop a Growth Mindset
This is a brief description of the course taken from Udemy, I really liked

## Reprogram your mind to become who you want to be
Our success is also a result of our approach to do something: **we need mindset (think in line which we want to achieve)**
We need to become the person who deserves to experience the desired situation: if I would be like that, then 
I would be in the situation I want (**To be today and tomorrow**) a compare two factors:
### BODY (easier but procastination)
Physical needs, but the result of instincts guide us to procastination because want (it's instant gratification)
### MIND
What feels guilty if not reach that goal (GOAL SETTING)
### SOLUTION (don't give space to what is not in your goal)
We need to train mind to take control of instincts (MIND control BODY): need to avoid bad habits not related to our goal.
**Body is a tool: control it with mind**. See exercise.

## UPGRADE MINDSET FOR SUCCESS : CHANGE BELIEFS , ACTIONS AND RESULTS
We need to create a loop where the belief construct/*positive* (cause->effect->cause...). A good way is
visualize our desired outcomes (visualize goal and influence our mind to think that it's possible to achieve). How?
- Define goal : Work in remote work at tech 
- Visualize living that situation (there is a shade between reality and what brain imagine)
- Create emotions: how would feel if could experience desired situation
- Take daily actions
### What you do every day matters more than what you do onec in a while
## EASY HABITS TO IMPROVE LIFE
Take quality of life to next level: two factors
- Non-Material (can't be bough): Health, education, self-determination, relationships
- Material: everything we can buy (have impact but matter less if quality change)
Happiness is our responsability (Habits play a big role with muscle of self-discipline). So, express
potential:
- Wake up early                                - Stretch (yoga session for  minutes)
- Morning mindset (Remind goal and top goals)  - Be grateful (see positive: what you've achieved and what you have others not)
- Eat healthy (Life style and quality)         - Make your bed 
- Stay Hydrated                                - Improve your sleep (esential to get energy)
## STRESS MANAGEMENT
Stress are circunstantes that create tension: inability to cope with some situations. Tips:
- Care of social relationship : do some activities, share moments
- Positive people: try to be in great environment (also ourselves and avoid bad attitude)
- Get creative: create something we like, writing, paint, what is inside ourselves
- Digital detox: not uninterrupted use of computer (before go to bed)
- Take a walk
- Enjoy the silence
- Get out of the routine : make some thing different (join event, discover something new: you would like or not)
## SET GOALS TO GET WHERE YOU WANT TO BE
Motivation can be related to how much you are near to what you would like to be (motivation + action = goal).
It is a process which follow some steps: *lack* (emotions), *tension*, *goal*, *action*. One of the most important
reasons is find meaning of life (continuous interruption or not enough motivation/ never manage to do something): **Investigate deeper**.
## STRATEGIES TO STAY MOTIVATED
- Set goals that inspire you
- Create daily plan
- Don't give up
- Focus on the present moment
- Visualize result
- Be the person you want to be
- Give value to your past successes
- Avoid those who doubt you
- Reward yourself
## PROCRASTINATION REASONS
- We are scared or anxious
- We tend to choose easier and less demanding way (*you still have the task*)
- Long deadlines (think work is more difficult and demanding)
- Random deadline (fill all time it takes) Brain choose based on short-term results
- **Reason 1:** Bad time management, no planning, lack of clarity, lot of breaks/distractions, postpone work to another day
- **Solution 1:** Make micro goals (not everything at the same time) to get productivity
- **Reason 2:** Lack of interest (emotions, feeling uncomfortable, try to avoid situation of stress)
- **Solution 2:** Connect purpose and passion for career sucess (what you do without being paid)
- **Reason 3:** Beating fear of failure, overcome fear of change, excuses stopping from lving best life, own obstacle
- **Solution 3:** Step out of our comfort zone
