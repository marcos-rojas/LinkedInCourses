## Car Price Prediction
We would like to help user to come up with best price: develop a model with *Car Features and MSRP* [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/cardataset).
Among features, we would like to predict MSRP (Manufacturer's suggested retail price). Thus, we would follow a project plan:
- Prepare data (column name, value name format) and do Exploratory Data Analysis
- Use linear regression to price prediction
- Understand linear regression logic
- Evaluate model with RMSE (root-mean-square error)
- Feature engineering
- Regularization (solve some paast problems with numerical values)
