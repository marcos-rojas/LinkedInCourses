# RPA (digital workforce)

Eliminate manual tasks with robot automation, [basics of RPA](https://www.simplilearn.com/learn-rpa-basics-skillup) where we will learn:
- Describe the meaning and growth trends of RPA
- List benefits of RPA (industry, organizations)
- Explain cost-benefit analysis and evolution of RPA
- Discuss types, processes and activities of RPA
- Describe ROI and 4 methods for calculate ROI for RPA
- Analyze key drivers of RPA in a enterprise
- List steps to enterprise RPA

This goals will be introduced through the following parts:
- What is RPA (robotic process automation)
- How does RPA work (autonomous and assited)
- ROI, building and business case
- Implementing RPA in enterprise
- List of RPA tools + selection checklist (process improvement, productivity, saving and ROI)
- Hotel case study

## Introduction
RPA is the use of software with AI and ML capabilities to handle high-volume,
repeatable tasks (queries, calculations, maintenance of records and transactions).

*It's easy for implementation:* system tools and processes can be implemented easily
without changing the existing infraestructure including legacy system and processes.
Most common tools ares: **Automation anywhere, blueprism, pega, workfusion**
Most common services: 
- **Open emails and attachments, logging into applications**
- **extract structured data from docs, merge files, process data**
- **follow if/then decision rules** 
- **fill in forms and move files/folders (collect, matching and verifying)**
- **connect to system API's and make complex calculations**
- **Monitor manual processes and learn how to perform them (machine learning)**
- **Read and write to databases, SQL queries automations**
- **Log into web/enterprise applications**
- **Copy/Pasta and scrap data from documents**

Industries: Banking and Financial, Human Resources, Marketing and Sales Department, CRM (Customer Relationship Management). ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), IT integration processes, Insurance agencies

According to Delloit: RPA make **cost-saving** (10-20% of onshore employee), **accurate taks**, efficient routines (x365 and faster than humans), **Timeline Optimization** (implemented without disrupting existing system)

According to MCKENSY : Return over Investment varies between 30% and 200% in the first year. It've very cheap
and fast in ensurance and banking sectors because need high policies.

## HOW RPA WORKS
There are RPA bots with functions, types of bots, types of RPA bot stup, *RPA recorder* and tasks of bots. There are 3 principal types of RPA bots:
- Unattended or autonomous: reduce back-office tasks and are launch by specified intervals, by other bots or with a data input in an specific location (trigger) 
- Attented: stored in user's machine and are triggered by user (when costumer service assistant has to make some tasks after interview with customer). Launch by devide of employee, autorun based on condition or when RPA client tool is selected
- Hybrid: it's the mix (front and back-office tasks).

**Setup:** by programming, GUI drag and drop (graphical user interface) or recorder (like excel from a data source: salesforce + SurveyMonkey= identify customer for target), self learning bot (try to mimic employee actions and recognize images of scraped screenshots, then are auditing by a person, contact employees to show how works, add a module)

## ROI building a business case
Measure ROI for RPA, calculate velocity, derive productivity, measure quality: **net_profit / cost_investment %**. There are 4 methods:
- Velocity : time back-office task take, and SLA time is reduced: *Measure of start to finish time for BOP (back-office processes)*
- Productivity: time taken by humans to complete process/task vs time taken by robots
- Quality: If correct ruls, governance and decisions -> human error is eliminated, *measure of accuracy of output before and after deployment of RPA (100% quality usually)*
- Compliance: *measure compliance before and after deployment*
Time can take between 6-12 weeks + 60-90 days nesting period (add efficiency, tighten rules/governances, see ROI realization).
## RPA Implementation in Enterprise
There are some drivers to implement RPA in our system of processes:
- Competitive advantage / growth: to innovate, grow and reduce cost, increase saving (remain profitable)
- Labour arbitrage: HR, IT, Accounting, DS has been maximized (hired outside for less). But multiple companies does the same (search for less price) and ROI can change (job roles has been maximized : *outsourcing*)
- Challenges faced by Business Process Outsourcing (BPO): changing political scenarios, meeting customer satisfaction, Limited budget, Health concerns (time zones, etc), customer attrition (desgaste, handle work with competitor), scarcity of talent,  employee attrition, communication chanels (social media), frequent disruptions (internet connection, power shutdown), brand equity (HR managers want employees as ambassors)
- IT changes : complex integration across industry (expensive and time consuming)
- Employee job satisfaction and retention (demoralization, less productive, etc)

### Steps to Implement RPA
![rpa_steps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74158005/131225301-cf48764d-0d52-4eed-b464-d846f36f94b1.JPG)
1. Repetitive or rule-based : data input, output, order/claim processing
2. Unnatendet vs autonomous: human intervention, actions self-triggered, remote access
3. Build RPA proof of concept : wheter PoC is feasible 
4. Build and automation CoE: eliminate issues in running/maintenance, low use of robot by selecting right processes, maintenance of code. Ask questions:
    - Will RPA be build from a central expert team or descentralized org
    - Is RPA team associated with business or IT
    - What are human roles in RPA units
    - How RPA integrates with IT, existing systems
    - What processes need to be developed to max efficiency
    - Implement change management and internal qualification (human worker)
Consider Infraestructure, Knowledge, Governance (policies, control action, procedures, security control, documentation (version control, upgrade, etc))
5. Change Management: how will work, skills requirements, organization change. Need strong roadmap (expected output, knowledge input and need control aspects, ownership by leaders, engagement with collaboration because more challenging tasks are delivered)
6. Takeaways to win in RPA: IT partnership, hidden cost analysis, scalability mindset (plan to implement and supervise growth)
## LIST OF RPA TOOLS
**Cognitive bots** (with NLP, image recognition or ML implementations) with unstructured data. **Self-learning bots** learn from employee actions.
- First wave RPA focused vendors 2000 (Blueprism then UiPath)
- Second wave 2010: for complex business problems (cognitive or learning bots that are strongly scientific) like Workfusion

BPO providers form agreements with RPA providers and turnkey solutions: so companies focus on business, automate the process, solve complex problems and immense programming efforts. Main criteria: *existing vendor relationship, quality of vendor support, technical criteria, ease of use, total cost*

UiPath: technology category, Automation anywhere (biggest market presence and use cases), blueprism (bot governance and deployment features)
